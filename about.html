  <br>
    <p class="text-center">    It is our mission to provide the highest quality produce in the shortest time possible. It is by serving our clients and their
      shipments in the least amount of time that we ensure that they are supplied with the freshest fruit and produce available today.
      Established since 1973, LLANES NUTRIFARM CORPORATION was centered on supplying fresh coconuts to local and international markets.
      Following the demand of the market, we have successfully ventured into diversifying our products. What first started as a small family
      business in 1973 has grown to offer a wide range of the highest-quality fresh, frozen and dried products to the global market as GRAY
      ENTERPRISE. Now, with more than 40 years of expertise in farming and export, Gray Enterprise is continuing the mission to provide the
      freshest produce both to our international and local clients. At Gray Enterprise, we believe that our core values determine how we treat
      our staff, clients, and partners. They define who we are and how we do our jobs. It also enables us to work together in the most
      effective way. We believe our name is synonymous to superior quality, integrity and dependability. This is why we take great pride in
      what we do and safeguard the highest quality and standards as well as ensuring that all necessary requirements are met prior to delivery.
      Gray Enterprise also supports neighboring farmers as well as the farms from remote areas. When purchasing our products, on top of
      receiving superior quality produce, you will also be supporting the local Philippine farmers generate income. On the behalf of the
      marginal small farmers, as our partners, we would like to thank you for patronizing our produce. We aim to be the number one coconut and
      farm products producer in the country. At Gray Enterprise, we strive to further improve our products and services by keeping up with the
      latest sciences and through upholding and preserving our long-term business relationships with our partners. We value quality, integrity
      and dependability in terms of supplying fresh young coconuts, fruits, dried leaves and powdered products. </center></p>
